# Problem Statement
A consumer finance company specializing in urban loans faces challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. This results in potential defaulters exploiting the system, leading to loan defaults and financial losses. The company seeks to optimize its lending process by leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect patterns in customer data that indicate difficulties in loan repayment.

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Identify high-risk applicants who are more likely to default on loans.
- Recommend actions such as loan denial, offering smaller loan amounts, or charging higher interest rates to risky applicants.
- Ensure that creditworthy customers, capable of repaying loans, are not mistakenly rejected, thereby improving the companyâ€™s loan approval process.
- Through EDA, the company aims to make data-driven decisions, enhancing both profitability and customer satisfaction by minimizing defaults while supporting deserving applicants.

# Key Findings
- **Gender and Default Rates:**  
  Female applicants tend to have a lower default rate compared to male applicants. Therefore, the loan company should prioritize issuing loans to female candidates, as they are more likely to repay on time.

- **Loan Type Preference:**  
  Clients opting for **revolving loans** demonstrate better repayment behavior. Issuing more revolving loans should be considered, as this loan type seems to attract more reliable borrowers.

- **Education Quality:**  
  Higher educational attainment correlates with better loan repayment. Clients with a higher level of education should be prioritized, as they are less likely to default on their loans.

- **Age and Risk Profile:**  
  Older clients are more reliable in repaying loans, while younger clients present a higher default risk. Extra caution should be taken when approving loans for younger clients, possibly requiring stricter criteria or offering smaller loan amounts.

- **Returning Clients:**  
  Repeat clients demonstrate better repayment behavior, suggesting that clients with a previous positive loan history should be preferred. This indicates trust and reliability based on prior performance.
